# 🛡️ TryHackMe: Cyber Kill Chain Write-Up  

## 🔍 Overview  
The **Cyber Kill Chain** is a framework developed by Lockheed Martin that defines the **seven phases** of a cyber attack, from reconnaissance to exfiltration. It helps security teams understand how adversaries operate and where defenses can be strengthened.  

## 🏆 Key Takeaways  
✅ Attackers follow a structured process: **Recon → Weaponization → Delivery → Exploitation → Installation → Command & Control → Actions on Objectives**.  
✅ Defenders can **break the chain** by disrupting attacks early in the process.  
✅ Helps organizations **map threats** and implement **preventative security measures**.  

## 🔍 Breakdown of Each Phase  
1️⃣ **Reconnaissance** – Attackers gather intelligence on the target.  
2️⃣ **Weaponization** – Malware or exploits are developed.  
3️⃣ **Delivery** – The payload is sent via phishing, drive-by downloads, etc.  
4️⃣ **Exploitation** – The vulnerability is exploited to gain access.  
5️⃣ **Installation** – Malware is installed to maintain persistence.  
6️⃣ **Command & Control (C2)** – Attackers establish remote control over the system.  
7️⃣ **Actions on Objectives** – Data exfiltration, destruction, or further attacks occur.  

## 📌 Real-World Applications  
- Used in **penetration testing** and **red team exercises**.  
- Helps SOC teams **identify attack patterns** and **mitigate risks**.  
- Organizations use it to **map threats** and improve security posture.
