## 🔍 Overview  
The **Pyramid of Pain** is a cybersecurity framework that helps analysts measure how difficult it is for attackers to change their tactics when defenders block certain indicators.  

## 🏆 Key Takeaways  
✅ Basic indicators like **hash values** are easy for attackers to change.  
✅ More advanced indicators like **TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)** are much harder to modify.  
✅ Security teams should focus on **behavioral detection** rather than just blocking simple indicators.  

## 📌 Real-World Applications
