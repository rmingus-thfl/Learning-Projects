# 🛡️ TryHackMe: OSI Model Write-Up  

## 🔍 Overview  
The **OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model)** is a **seven-layer framework** that defines how data is transmitted and received across networks. Each layer has a specific function, ensuring seamless communication between devices.  

## 🏆 Key Takeaways  
✅ The OSI Model consists of **seven layers**, each handling different aspects of network communication.  
✅ Helps standardize networking protocols and troubleshooting methods.  
✅ Used to understand how data moves from **applications to physical transmission**.  

## 🔍 Breakdown of the Seven Layers  
1️⃣ **Application Layer** – Interfaces with user applications (e.g., web browsers, email clients).  
2️⃣ **Presentation Layer** – Formats and encrypts data for transmission.  
3️⃣ **Session Layer** – Manages connections between devices.  
4️⃣ **Transport Layer** – Ensures reliable data transfer (TCP/UDP).  
5️⃣ **Network Layer** – Handles IP addressing and routing.  
6️⃣ **Data Link Layer** – Manages MAC addresses and error detection.  
7️⃣ **Physical Layer** – Defines hardware transmission (cables, signals).  

## 📌 Real-World Applications  
- Used in **network troubleshooting** to pinpoint issues at specific layers.  
- Helps cybersecurity professionals understand **packet flow and attack vectors**.  
- Supports **protocol standardization** for seamless communication across devices.
