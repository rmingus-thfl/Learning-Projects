# 🛡️ TryHackMe: Diamond Model Write-Up  

## 🔍 Overview  
The **Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis** is a cybersecurity framework that helps analysts map out the relationships between **adversaries, victims, infrastructure, and capabilities**. It provides a structured approach to understanding cyber threats and attacker behavior.  

## 🏆 Key Takeaways  
✅ The model consists of **four core features**:  
   - **Adversary** – The attacker or threat actor.  
   - **Infrastructure** – The tools and systems used in the attack.  
   - **Capability** – The techniques and malware used.  
   - **Victim** – The target of the attack.  
✅ Helps defenders **visualize attack relationships** and track adversary movements.  
✅ Used in **threat intelligence** to analyze intrusion patterns and predict future attacks.  

## 🔍 How It Works  
- Security teams **map real-world threats** using the Diamond Model attributes.  
- Analysts **connect attacker behaviors** to known adversary groups.  
- Helps organizations **strengthen defenses** by understanding attacker motivations.  

## 📌 Real-World Applications  
- Used in **SOC operations** to analyze **intrusion patterns**.  
- Helps defenders **predict attacker movements** and **strengthen security posture**.  
- Supports **incident response investigations** by linking attack attributes.
