# 🛡️ Continuous Monitoring Plan for DoD Project  

## 🔍 Overview  
To ensure alignment between the **risk/threat environment** and the implemented **control system**, a **Continuous Monitoring Plan** has been developed. Failure of controls poses a threat to the security environment, making ongoing monitoring a critical security measure.  

## 🏆 Key Takeaways  
✅ **Operational vigilance** – Continuous monitoring reduces risk exposure.  
✅ **Structured assessment** – Regular **incident reporting, auditing, and security evaluations** ensure control effectiveness.  
✅ **Defined responsibilities** – Security personnel follow a **reporting and evaluation framework** to maintain compliance.  

## 🔍 Continuous Monitoring Process  
### **1️⃣ Incident Reporting & Documentation**  
- **Software engineering staff** report all security incidents using the **incident reporting system**.  
- **Project Manager** oversees adherence to behavioral controls & flags deviations.  
- **General auditing team** conducts **bi-weekly control testing**, tracking the following:  
  - Functionality – Are all control components operational?  
  - Relevance – Does the control still match the threat environment?  
  - Testing data – Document test results & submit reports to **Security Manager**.  

### **2️⃣ Quarterly Assessments & Compliance Reviews**  
- **Assessment Team 2** completes a full security assessment every **quarter**.  
- Findings are documented in the **HMT Risk Assessment Form**.  
- Results are submitted to the **Security Manager** for review.  

### **3️⃣ Security Management & Authorization**  
- **Security Manager** analyzes monitoring & incident data, investigates deviations, and assigns remediation tasks.  
- Compiles **quarterly reports** for **upper management & board of directors** to ensure compliance.

## 📌 Real-World Applications  
- Helps maintain **DoD cybersecurity standards** and compliance.  
- Supports **continuous risk management and organizational security governance**.  
- Ensures **accountability and proactive control assessments** in high-security environments.

- ## 🔍 Security Tools for Continuous Monitoring  

To enhance security operations, the following tools are used for **monitoring, threat detection, and compliance**:  

### **SIEM & Threat Analytics**  
- **Splunk** – Log monitoring & anomaly detection.  
- **Microsoft Sentinel** – AI-driven security event analysis.  
- **QRadar** – Enterprise-grade SIEM for SOC teams.  

### **Intrusion Detection & Prevention**  
- **Snort** – Network-based IDS for threat detection.  
- **Suricata** – Advanced IDS with deep packet inspection.  

### **Vulnerability & Patch Management**  
- **Nessus** – Automated vulnerability assessment & scanning.  
- **OpenVAS** – Free tool for identifying security weaknesses.  

These tools ensure **proactive security monitoring** and strengthen the **risk management process**. 🚀
